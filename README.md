# SecureScoreReportExporter

This is a fork of the Powershell script from GCIT found on this link: https://gcits.com/knowledge-base/export-customers-microsoft-secure-scores-to-csv-and-html-reports/

I added a percentage calulation and CSV export for Failed tenants as this helps MSP's to get an overview of tenants to fix.
